About Wynntils
========
Wynntils is a Wynncraft Mod that seeks to enhance the user's gameplay with a variety of customizable options and additions.

Setup the Workspace
========
Doing the setup of Wynntils is quite simple, first you will need to run forge ``setupDecompWorkspace`` gradle command, with that all the forge source will be generated. Thats it!
<br> Building the mod is even simpler just call the ``buildDependents`` and the artifact should be generated.

You can also setup a test environment, using Intellij execute the ``genIntellijRuns`` task, which will generate a run environment for you.
