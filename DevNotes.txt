Optimization shit:
	• Guis' drawRect, dont use these, we need a Gui/GuiScreen Extension with
	  a direct Color parameter.. Currently new Color().getRGB() goes &
	  takes power to proccess and later is being decoded back to "Color"
	  inside drawRect.. also doesnt accept alpha..
	
	• OnNether, OnWars, OnWorld, OnServer dont need checking each run,
	  World join and disconnect can change a boolean for on server if it IS the server
	  World join also works when switching worlds, therefore, use it to determine if
	  in wars/game/nether and set a boolean..
